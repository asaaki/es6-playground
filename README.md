# ES6/Babel Playground

- A tiny project dummy for writing ES6 code and compiling it to JS.
- It follows the AMD approach and ships with _almond.js_ (lightweight replacement for the _require.js_ loader).
- Also ships with an AMDified version of the _babel external helpers_ (`babelHelpers.js`) to reduce heavy code duplication
- I love _make!_ :wink:
